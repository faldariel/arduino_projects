# arduino_projects

Arduino Projects is a learning pool with small projects developed for learning purposes. Because of this they are intended to be easy to understand for even beginners or people with limited knowledge about programming. There will be a lot of comments to explain the code and business standard code reviews have been performed.

Every project in this repository will, when finished, hold the following:

* Arduino code
* Circuit diagram
* A small demo video

Unless other mikrocontroller stated all demos use Arduino Nano and load the programmer using Arduino IDE.

All projects are, of course, free to use but only approved contributors will be allowed to push to this repository.
